"@RegondoZiso @daddyhope UN is not funding our healthcare budget for immigrants legal or illegal  in South Africa let‚Äôs get that straight. We have no obligations to illegal immigrants and citizens of other nations. South Africans are dying not having access to their own healthcare system."
"@PSAFPATRIOT south africa is unpatriotic, busy feeding,educating and providing healthcare to illegal immigrants and not deporting them to fight dictatorships in their own country"
"@MapulaMokgosang @Leversmanganye Limpopo is overwhelmed by an influx of Zimbabwean illegal immigrants into their healthcare system daily.. Dr Phophi is very specific about this issue she never alluded to South Africa as a whole, but Limpopo which she is the MEC of."
"MEC Dr @PhophiRamathuba is at it again. The message is clear. ‚úä I love this clip which has so much context. Immigrants are welcome as always to get the non primary healthcare in South Africa, but their governments must pay the bills.  @HealthLimpopo @HealthZA  [Thread]  https://t.co/lvbYAjGp2Q"
"@Tinoedzazvimwe1 @MethodChabenga So? Mr Charamba what's the point of mentioning it if the South Africans paid? Isn't it the same as elite Zimbabweans going abroas for medical care? Aren't we talking about illegal immigrants crossing the border into South Africa just for healthcare."
"The situation has been worsened by South Africa's Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba's anti-immigrants outburst, in which she harangued a Zimbabwean patient at Bela Bela Hospital in Limpopo. Ramathuba bitterly complained immigrants were overstretching SA's healthcare system.  https://t.co/ERBu1aaNMQ"
"@AdvoBarryRoux They are holed up there in south africa because in south africa an illegal immigrant can get healthcare, send their kids to school, work without a permit, rent a room/house. Kindly deport them. You see them daily in your neighbourhoods, you work with them deport them. We beg you"
"@MightiJamie @Paul_Mokale 2. For example, last week you were very quick to defend illegal immigrants using South Africa's Healthcare facilities by quoting the Constitution and denouncing MEC #DrPhopiRamathupa but were very silent on the health crisis faced by Zimbabweans"
"@SundayTimesZA Rubbish. The audacity of printing statements from people who find pleasure in breaking our laws at every turn.  In South Africa, by the way, immigrants must go to private hospitals and pay for healthcare!!"
"@MSF_southafrica @dailymaverick @SABCNews @HealtheNews @Checkpoint_eNCA @MSF_access @SECTION27news @TAC @HealthZA @City_Press You are even embarrassed to use the word 'illegal'.  For as long as you don't aid global governments to fight illegal immigration, your purpose to exist is questionable.  Instead, build hospitals where you can fund &amp; provide healthcare to illegal immigrants and stop annoying us."

"Change the constitution of South Africa which allows illegal immigrants to have the same free healthcare services as citizens of the country by the constitution what #DrPhophi did was wrong if we want foreigners to pay for healthcare services CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION"
"@ZwaneSiguqa In the US Healthcare is expensive, coupled with tertiary education . This applies to citizens.. So how about a foreigner? But South Africa, with free healthcare and free education, is expected to take of over 60 million of its citizens, and illegal immigrants as well? not fair"
"@TimesLIVE EFF is not South Africa and therefore we're behind the MEC 100%. We can't have our Healthcare or any public servants being strained by illegal immigrants. Consequently, South Africans can't even access the very same facilities built for us to utilize tsek!"
"People go deep as far as retrieving immigrants acts and healthcare acts of South Africa but fail to retrieve their own countries and government acts to silence the voters of this country as if we don't have rights to enjoy whatever belongs to us."
"That way the rights to free healthcare for everyone remains, but South Africa gets paid by its neighbouring African countries on the free health care it provides to legal immigrants,"
"@MmusiMaimane Should we now disregard real issues that affects South African citizens who are tax payers and politicise this critical issue of the influx of illegal immigrants in South Africa, u don't utilise public healthcare facilities, u have no clue of what ordinary SAns are going through"
